# Gesture-Controlled-Media-Player
This project, Gesture Controlled Media-Player, serves as an extension to media players, such as Spotify and Netflix, which allows users to control what they are listening to or watching using hand gestures.

  
INSTRICTIONS TO RUN PROGRAM:
1. Allow the terminal access to the webcam
2. Open the terminal and go to where the python code is located
3. Run the command 'python3 main.py'
4. You should then be prompted to enter which media player you are using and the color range of your hand. 
The default is a blue glove which is what I used for testing.

NOTES:
1. The media player commands will only work for iOS
2. The Spotify media player refers to the Spotify desktop app
3. Netflix refers to the Netflix website in the Google Chrome web browser.
4. For Netflix, Chrome should already have a window with a movie or TV show on
5. The volume controls change the in-app volume, not the laptops volume.

SPOTIFY CONTROLS:
* Open Spotify 5 fingers
* Pause/Play: 2 fingers
* Skip song: Move hand to the right
* Previous song: Move hand to the left
* Volume up: Move hand up
* Volume down: Move hand down
